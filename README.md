To create a custom Guffal bot for your Discord server, let's break it down step by step, and I will propose some ideas for games that could be fun for your server. I'll guide you through the process of creating the bot, its functionality, and how it can be submitted to GitHub.

Key Features for Guffal Bot:
The bot should be interactive and engaging for your Discord community. Here's an outline of what it could include:

1. Game Integration:
Trivia Game: A bot that asks multiple-choice or open-ended questions from various categories like general knowledge, pop culture, gaming, or even specific topics related to your server's community.
Rock-Paper-Scissors Game: A classic game where users can challenge the bot to play rock-paper-scissors.
Tic-Tac-Toe: A simple two-player game (with the bot as one of the players), where users can challenge each other to tic-tac-toe matches.
Word Guessing Game (Hangman): Players can guess letters to form a word or phrase, and the bot tracks the number of incorrect guesses.
Number Guessing Game: Players try to guess a number the bot randomly chooses within a specified range, with hints for each guess.
2. Fun Features:
Guffal Quote Generator: The bot can create or randomly choose humorous or inspirational quotes related to Guffal and share them with users.
Guffal Avatar: A fun feature where users can "summon" a Guffal avatar or create custom avatars for the bot to display.
3. User Interaction:
Leaderboard: Track scores for trivia, tic-tac-toe, and other games to display a leaderboard in a channel for your community.
XP System: Reward players with XP points after each game they play, allowing them to level up and unlock cool features or custom commands.
4. Commands:
/play [game]: Initiate a game like trivia, tic-tac-toe, or number guessing.
/leaderboard: View the top players of different games.
/help: Displays all available bot commands.
Setting Up the Bot:
I’ll outline how you could go about creating this bot in Python with Discord.py. Here’s a high-level approach to implementing this bot.

Step 1: Set up your bot
Create a new bot on Discord Developer Portal.
Copy the bot token after creating the bot.
Step 2: Set up the Python environment
Install Python and the required dependencies:
bash
Копировать код

pip install discord.py
import discord
from discord.ext import commands
import random
import asyncio

# Define bot prefix and intents
intents = discord.Intents.default()
intents.message_content = True
bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!', intents=intents)

# Welcome message
@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'Logged in as {bot.user}')

# Trivia Game Command
@bot.command()
async def trivia(ctx):
    questions = [
        {"question": "What is the capital of France?", "answer": "paris"},
        {"question": "Who wrote 'Hamlet'?", "answer": "shakespeare"},
        {"question": "What is 2 + 2?", "answer": "4"},
    ]
    question = random.choice(questions)
    await ctx.send(question["question"])

    def check(message):
        return message.author == ctx.author and message.channel == ctx.channel

    try:
        msg = await bot.wait_for('message', check=check, timeout=30)
        if msg.content.lower() == question["answer"]:
            await ctx.send("Correct!")
        else:
            await ctx.send(f"Wrong! The correct answer was {question['answer']}.")
    except asyncio.TimeoutError:
        await ctx.send("You took too long to answer!")

# Tic-Tac-Toe Command
@bot.command()
async def ttt(ctx):
    # Placeholder: You can implement a full game here with a grid and interaction
    await ctx.send("Tic-Tac-Toe feature coming soon!")

# Rock-Paper-Scissors Command
@bot.command()
async def rps(ctx, choice: str):
    options = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    bot_choice = random.choice(options)

    if choice.lower() not in options:
        await ctx.send("Invalid choice! Choose rock, paper, or scissors.")
        return

    await ctx.send(f"Bot chose {bot_choice}. You chose {choice.lower()}.")
    if choice.lower() == bot_choice:
        await ctx.send("It's a tie!")
    elif (choice.lower() == "rock" and bot_choice == "scissors") or (choice.lower() == "paper" and bot_choice == "rock") or (choice.lower() == "scissors" and bot_choice == "paper"):
        await ctx.send("You win!")
    else:
        await ctx.send("Bot wins!")

# Error Handling for Unknown Commands
@bot.event
async def on_command_error(ctx, error):
    if isinstance(error, commands.CommandNotFound):
        await ctx.send("Unknown command. Use !help to see available commands.")

# Run the bot


Step 4: Set up your GitHub repository
Create a GitHub repository to store your bot’s code.

Push the code to the repository:

git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/guffal-bot.git
git push -u origin main


Include a README file with instructions on how to set up the bot. Here’s an example:
